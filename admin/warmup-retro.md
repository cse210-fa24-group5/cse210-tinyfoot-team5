# Git Push Master - Warmup Retrospective

## Team Dynamic
We are proud of the work that we did this past week, and how we grew together as a team. There was a very good team dynamic, and we all got along with eachother pretty well.

## Workstyle
We worked synchronously for the most part, which had a lot of challenges.
- As a whole team, together in a meeting we would work through each section of the homework live, with the exception of wrapping up Part 3.
- The positive side is that we got everyone to participate, it gave everyone a chance to get to know eachother better, and we were able to have quick communication about gaps in understanding and make concise decisions
- The negative side, is that it was innefficient, or at least it would be for a larger project.
  - There was a lot done that could be done in parallel, if we had taken the time to write design document of the software, delegate which parts of the software to different people
  - For example, we could have said at the beginning "We're going to be using a custom component architecture - the custom component will have x and y attributes, and the user can optionally provide their own div/span for footnotes, we expect this kind of styling with CSS", etc.
    - Then, we could have prtitioned our team to work on CSS/styling the buttons, styling the popovers, and another for doing to open/close functionality in JS.
    - We could have taken it a step further, and said "the JS script will look like this, calling these functions (which are to be implemented) on these events" and had people implement the given functions (like popover open, and popover close) in parallel.
  - However, you can see that for such a small project, the amount of effort it would have taken to take this more formal route of coordinating and splitting the project up like this, would have taken much more effort than us all group programming the small JS file together. Once the fundamentals were down however/our MVP was implemented, we were able to split work up effectively.
