# October 16th 2024 Meeting

- Meeting agenda
    - Team Lead Meeting with Kashish
        - Alan dropped the class
        - Our bigfoot changes are good, they don't need to be bigger than a traffic light 
        - Will do traffic light changes for littlefoot as well
    - Look through littlefoot
        - make changes
        - build changes
        - test changes
        - Push it all into a repo
    - Look at Jack's tinyfoot demo

- Littlefoot
    - Cloned littlefoot repo and created a new on inside of our repo
    - Goal: use Shivani's css code, and apply it to littlefoot
        - Then, build littlefoot. We don't know how yet, but probably npm build
- Results
    - We tried pulling and installing littelfoot locally on windows computers, installing npm
        - found some compatibility issues with npm scripts: npm scripts were written using linux commands
        - ended up needing to use github codespaces in order to get things running for everyone
    - Once we had it pulled and installed, we modified the src/littlefoot.css to display the footnote as a sideways traffic light
        - we then built it using npm, and created a template folder containing a demo index.html file that references the built version of out littlefoot
        - pushed the code to a different branch, different people all made changes to the branch, we made an issue, then a PR, and then merged it
    - We will use notes for littlefoot review from last meeting
