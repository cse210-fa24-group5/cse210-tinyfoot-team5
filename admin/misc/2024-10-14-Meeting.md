# October 14th 2024 Meeting

- Jakob looked into getting Bigfoot running and built over the weekend
- Jack looked into littlefoot, got it running locally
    - Difference between bigfoot and littlefoot: littlefoot does not require jquery to be imported for proper use
    - Slightly different syntax 

- When, where and how are we going to conduct future meetings
    - In-Person Monday at 2pm seems to work for everyone
    - Virtual Friday at 2pm 
    - Optional meetings Wednesday @ 2pm depending on workload

- We should put a "Project Updates" channel in Mattermost to signify when someone has made a change to a project/needs a PR to be approved

- Bigfoot review:   
    - Talk about how to get it to work
    - Things that were challenging to get to to work (grunftile stuff, jquery version, coffee stuff)
        -  scss vs css
    - Architecture/challengest understanding the architecture
    - Organization quality is pretty standard - this most difficult thing was comprehending a repo with old technologies
        - Functionality is good and supports lack of javascript, accomodates more users potentially  
        - the entirety of the logic is within a. single coffee file, that is hard to read due to both all the code living in the same place, and also the use of coffeescript is less standard, and may grow less and less compatible with current web standards.
        - link to the project website was broken :\
        - a little harder to get up and running compared to littlefoot, since it doesn't give step by step install instructions, and requires download and install of bigfoot and jquery (without direct instruction about how to install it)
    - Would we use it?
        - Probably not. It requires an old jquery version as an additional dependency
    - Would we want to overhaul it/make changes?
        - No. Uses older technologies with older syntax that would be difficult to maintain.
    - last commit 8 years ago
    - REALLY cool 3D text comments
        - regular text comments are inconsistent, with CSS files //Text effects a non-text object
    - Extremely gross usage of html as a string in the coffee file


- Made changes to bigfoot, created bigtrafficlight.
    - the footnote now loks like a traffic light
    - We modified the button css file, as well as the coffee file
        - css of button itself was changed to align circles vertically and center them, and we changed it the background to black.
        - the button was reprented by 3 intividual circle html objects that were injected directly as a string in coffeescript
            - very gross
        - We modified the injected string to change the colors of the circles
    - We also made a bash script that builds our fork of bigfoot using grunt, copies it to our testing repos directory, and runs npm start to build our test repo to observe changes.


- Littlefoot review
    - We prefer littlefoot
    - Its very user friendly, easier to implement compared to bigfoot (no jquery dependency)
        - getting it up and running was as easy as just opening a premade html file
    - Documentation is a lot easier to read, it contains a provided html demo file
        - Documentation also gives implementation details (gives straight up code that you can use)
        - All information needed to get the project running exists in github/the repo, and you don't need to go to external sources
    - The repo is a lot bigger than bigfoot for what is essentially the exact same functionality
    `   - typescript is more modern, but is just another dependency
    - CI/CD exists here that does not exist in bigfoot, the project seems to be a lot more maintainable
        - unit tests with code coverage, and code, commit, and test linting 
        - likely much more maintained due to this, last commit was 4 days from writing
        - changelogs
    - Modular, more modular than bigfoot :////

- Warm-up project: what should our technology stack be? Should we fork off of littlefooot?
    - We should try adding small extensions to both and see effort required
        - We should make the same change to both projects to see the difference in development
            - Possible changes?
                - Change the look of a button/font/make it look more hip
                    - wingdings
                - Add css tag to footnotes
                    - start with this one
                - Add a new class for displaying footnotes
                    - display footnotes from top
                - Switch between footnote types/regular footnotes
                - Open multiple footnotes at the same time
                    - "stay open" flag on a footnote/class
                    - only stays open if its an inline footnote
                - Big change idea: Add footnote footnotes
                    - Footnote trees
                    - Back button to go back to previous footnote


- Based on Tuesdays class, we'll decide whether to work hybrid on wednesday on running littlefoot and implementing a change.
    - We still have yet to delegate titles, we are all working in one big group programming session.
