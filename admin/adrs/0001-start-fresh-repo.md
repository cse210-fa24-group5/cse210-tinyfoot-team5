# Start a new repository for Tinyfoot with plain JS

## Context and Problem Statement

What stack should we choose to implement our custom footnote?


## Considered Options

* Bigfoot Fork
* Littlefoot Fork
* Fresh repo with Typescript
* Fresh repo with plain JS/HTML/CSS
* Fresh repo with no JS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Fresh repo with plain JS/HTML/CSS", because we feel like bigfoot and littlefoot have too much for what we feel can be accomplished with a lot simpler CSS, HTML, and JS. Typescript might have been nice, but ultimately not necessary for what we feel is join to be a very small change. 
We are opting to use JS for now because the ease of use in modifying properties of HTML objects on demand, but are open to removing JS if we find easier ways to do the same job in development.
