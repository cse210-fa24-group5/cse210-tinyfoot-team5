This is our version of tinyfoot, which we wrote from scratch. The user declares a tinyfoot as a <tiny-foot> custom tag in html with property of data-footnote, which would be the footnote's content. The default button is 3 dots, and if the user wants to change the text content of the button, they can write the text inside the text content section of the html tag. When a footnote is opened, the user can close it by clicking another footnote, clicking the 'x' button, or click anywhere else in the page.
